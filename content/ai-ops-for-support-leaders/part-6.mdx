title: AI Ops for Support Leaders, Part 6
description: Tooling and architecture for a stable AI program.
---

If your system has five sources of truth, you will ship contradictions.
Part 6 focuses on architecture.
Keep the system simple.
Keep change control real.

The goal
- One source for content.
- One source for routing rules.
- One source for prompts and tool instructions.
- One place for metrics.
- One path for releases.

Pick your source of truth
Choose one primary home for user-facing knowledge.
Examples:
- Mintlify for docs-as-code
- Zendesk Guide for support portal content

Rule
Do not maintain the same article in two places.
If you must mirror, automate the mirror.

Structure your content
AI works better when content is structured.
Use this pattern for key topics.
- Summary
- Eligibility and rules
- Steps
- Edge cases
- What to do if stuck
- Escalation path

Add decision points
Write rules in a way that maps to user decisions.
Bad
“Submit proof of residency.”
Good
“If your address changed in the last 30 days, submit X. If not, submit Y.”

Use reusable snippets
Repeat content creates drift.
Create snippets for:
- Identity steps
- Policy disclaimers
- Red zone refusals
- Contact options

Use one taxonomy
Make intent and content align.
If your top intent is “Proof of Residency,” your docs should have the same phrase.

Minimum metadata
Add a small set of tags in your own process, even if the tool does not enforce it.
- State or program
- Audience type
- Channel
- Risk level
- Last reviewed date

Environments
Run two environments.
- Staging
- Production

Stage changes in staging first.
Test the page.
Test the prompt.
Test the routing.

Change control
Log every change.
Track:
- What changed
- Why
- Owner
- Approver
- Release stage
- Metric to watch

If your AI platform supports versioning, use it.
If not, keep a change log in the repo.

Integrations
Keep tool actions narrow.
Bot actions should:
- Read data
- Create tickets
- Collect context

Avoid high-risk actions in early stages.
Example: account changes.
Keep those for humans.

Routing rules
Keep rules explicit.
- Route by program, brand, or state
- Route by issue type
- Route by risk

Avoid rules based on vibes.
Avoid rules based on text match alone.
Use intent plus a confirm step when risk exists.

Analytics design
Decide what you measure before you scale.
Minimum data points per conversation:
- Channel
- Intent
- Contained or escalated
- Escalation reason
- Red zone triggered
- User rating, if available

Store the intent in your ticket system
Put the AI intent in a ticket field.
Report from the ticket system.
Keep one reporting layer.

Common architecture patterns
Pattern A
- Mintlify for content
- AI platform for orchestration
- Zendesk for tickets and reporting

Pattern B
- Zendesk Guide for content
- AI platform for orchestration
- Zendesk for tickets and reporting

Pick one and commit to it.

What to do next
- Decide your single content home
- Define staging and production
- Add a change log
- Store intent in Zendesk ticket fields
- Align taxonomy across bot, tickets, and docs

Part 7 preview
Risk and incident response.
Kill switches, postmortems, and ongoing governance.
