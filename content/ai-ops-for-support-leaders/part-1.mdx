title: AI Ops for Support Leaders, Part 1
description: Operating model for AI in Support.
---

AI ships fast. Support teams pay the bill when it breaks.

This series is about running AI like an ops program, not a demo.

What this part covers
- The operating model you need before you scale AI
- The roles you assign, so work does not drift
- The metrics that keep you honest
- The workflows that keep quality stable

Who this is for
You lead Support, Support Ops, CX Ops, or a Technical Support function.
You own tooling, staffing, and outcomes.
You want AI value without chaos.

The problem
AI changes three things at once.
- Volume patterns shift, because deflection changes demand.
- Quality risk rises, because outputs drift and teams over-trust.
- Ownership gets fuzzy, because no one “owns” the AI backlog.

Most failures are boring.
- No single owner.
- No change control.
- No coaching loop.
- No definition of done for “good” answers.

The goal
Run AI like a system.
You want predictable outcomes:
- Consistent answers
- Controlled change
- Clear escalation paths
- Stable metrics week over week

The AI ops operating model
Use this model.
1. Intake
2. Triage
3. Fix
4. Approve
5. Release
6. Measure
7. Coach
8. Iterate

1. Intake
Every AI issue needs a home.
Treat these as first-class work items:
- Wrong answers
- Missing coverage
- Bad tone or unsafe outputs
- Broken tools and integrations
- Routing mistakes
- Policy conflicts

Create one intake path.
Pick one:
- A Zendesk form for internal AI issues
- A Slack workflow that creates a ticket
- A GitHub issue template if your docs and prompts live in code

Minimum fields
- Channel: chat, email, voice, help center
- Issue type: wrong answer, missing answer, workflow bug, routing, policy
- Severity: low, medium, high
- Example: link or transcript snippet
- Expected answer: what “right” looks like

2. Triage
Triage is about two decisions.
- Is this a knowledge problem or a workflow problem?
- Is this safe to ship without approval?

Suggested triage buckets
- Knowledge gap
- Policy answer change
- Workflow change
- Tool or integration defect
- Red zone or exclusion required
- Needs more context

Define your red zones
Red zones are topics where you require a human.
Examples:
- Account access changes
- Payments and refunds
- Legal or compliance topics
- Identity verification
- Anything that exposes private data

If your AI touches red zones, you need written rules.
No exceptions.
Trust dies fast.

3. Fix
Fix work should happen in the same place every time.
If your system spans tools, keep one source of truth.
Examples:
- Knowledge lives in Mintlify
- Prompts live in a prompt repo
- Routing rules live in your AI platform
- Zendesk fields and triggers live in Zendesk

Fix checklist
- Add or update the source content
- Add examples, edge cases, and exclusions
- Add a test prompt, plus expected output
- Confirm the output aligns with policy

4. Approve
Approvals prevent silent regressions.

Approval roles you need
- Policy partner or program owner for policy answers
- Support Ops for workflow and routing changes
- Support leadership for red zones and exclusions
- Engineering for tool changes and integrations

Approval rules
- Any policy answer change requires approval
- Any routing or escalation change requires approval
- Any red zone edit requires approval
- Any integration change requires approval

5. Release
Release should be staged.
Do not flip everything on.

Release sequence
- Internal only, support team uses it first
- Small cohort of customers
- Broader rollout by channel
- Full rollout with monitoring

Add release notes
Keep a short log:
- What changed
- Why
- Who approved
- What metric you expect to move

6. Measure
If you do not measure, you are guessing.

Core metrics
- Containment rate by channel
- Deflection rate for top intents
- Escalation rate after AI interaction
- CSAT and sentiment for AI handled conversations
- Reopen rate or follow-up rate
- Hallucination rate, tracked as confirmed wrong answers
- Time to fix for AI issues

Minimum dashboards
- Weekly AI performance summary
- Top failing intents
- Red zone attempts
- Regression alerts for CSAT and containment

7. Coach
Coaching is the difference between rollout and adoption.

You need two coaching loops.
- Support agents, when AI hands off or misroutes
- AI owners, when failures repeat

Coaching format
- Weekly 30-minute calibration
- Review 5 good interactions
- Review 5 failures
- Capture changes as backlog items

8. Iterate
Iteration is the whole point.
Your backlog should always have:
- Coverage expansion for high-volume intents
- Quality fixes for known failure modes
- Tooling fixes for handoff and routing
- Content improvements in your docs

Roles and ownership
Assign these. Put names next to them.

AI program owner
- Owns roadmap, backlog, and outcomes
- Runs weekly review
- Owns release decision

Knowledge owner
- Owns source content quality
- Owns content standards
- Coordinates translations and updates

Workflow owner
- Owns routing, triggers, and escalation paths
- Owns integration requirements
- Owns QA for workflows

QA owner
- Defines scoring
- Runs calibrations
- Tracks regressions

Policy partner
- Owns policy correctness
- Approves policy answer changes
- Defines exclusions and safe language

If one person owns all of this, you have a bottleneck.
If no one owns it, you have chaos.

What to do this week
If you want progress in seven days, do this.
- Write your red zones in one page
- Pick one intake path and one backlog
- Add triage buckets and severity rules
- Schedule a weekly calibration
- Create a release checklist
- Pick five metrics and report them weekly

Next in Part 2
How to design your intake and triage system so your AI backlog stays small.
Plus templates for:
- Issue intake
- Triage categories
- Release notes
- Weekly review agenda
