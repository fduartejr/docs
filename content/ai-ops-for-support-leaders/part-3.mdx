title: AI Ops for Support Leaders, Part 3
description: Metrics, alerts, and weekly review that keep quality stable.
---

Part 3 covers measurement and review.

Goal
Detect drift early.
Fix root causes.
Protect user trust.

Three metric tiers
Tier 1, outcomes
1) Containment rate
2) Escalation rate after bot interaction
3) CSAT for bot-handled conversations
4) Follow-up rate within 24 hours

Tier 2, quality signals
1) Confirmed wrong answer rate
2) Policy mismatch rate
3) Handoff failure rate
4) Tone defect rate

Tier 3, operations
1) Time to detect
2) Time to triage
3) Time to fix
4) Backlog age by severity

Definitions
Containment rate
Bot conversations with no human agent involvement divided by total bot conversations.

Escalation rate after bot interaction
Conversations with bot plus later human involvement divided by total bot conversations.

Follow-up rate
Users who return with the same goal within 24 hours divided by total bot conversations.

Confirmed wrong answer rate
Count of validated wrong answers divided by sampled conversations for the week.

Pick a sampling plan
Avoid random vibes.
Use a repeatable method.

Weekly sample
1) Top 5 intents by volume
2) Top 5 intents by escalations
3) Red zone attempts
4) New or changed flows

For each group, review 10 conversations.
Total: 30 to 50 per week.

Scoring rubric
Score each conversation on five checks.
1) Accuracy
2) Completeness
3) Policy alignment
4) Safety and red zone handling
5) Next step clarity

Use a simple scale
0 Fail
1 Partial
2 Pass

A weekly review agenda
Keep the meeting short.
Thirty minutes works.

Agenda
1) Last week numbers
2) Biggest regressions
3) Top three fixes shipped
4) Top three failures still open
5) Red zone attempts
6) Decisions and owners

Outputs
1) Three backlog items with severity
2) One content update batch
3) One workflow change batch
4) One monitoring rule update

Alerts
Set alerts for changes, not absolute values.

Alert examples
1) Containment drop by 10 percent week over week
2) CSAT drop by 5 points week over week
3) Escalation spike on a single intent
4) Red zone attempts spike
5) Wrong answer rate above threshold

Thresholds
Start conservative.
Adjust after four weeks of baseline data.

Weekly report format
Use one page.

Section 1, Summary
1) Wins
2) Risks
3) Decisions

Section 2, Metrics

2) Escalations
3) CSAT
4) Follow-ups

Section 3, Top issues
List five.
Each line includes owner and due date.

Section 4, Fixes shipped
