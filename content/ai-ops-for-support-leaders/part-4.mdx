description: Release management for safe changes and stable outcomes.

Part 4 covers release management.

Goal
Ship changes without regressions.
Keep approvals clear.
Keep rollout controlled.

Why releases fail
1) No approval path.
2) No staged rollout.
3) No rollback plan.
4) No monitoring plan.

Change types
1) Content change
Docs, KB, translations, examples.
2) Prompt change
System prompt, intent rules, tool instructions.
3) Workflow change
Routing, tags, forms, triggers, escalation paths.
4) Tool change
Integrations, actions, auth, API behavior.
5) Red zone change
Exclusions, refusals, handoff rules.

Release checklist
Before release

4) Expected behavior stated
5) Monitoring metrics listed
6) Rollback plan written

During release
1) Monitor the chosen metrics
2) Review 10 conversations from the new flow
3) Log defects fast

After release
1) Weekly review includes the change
2) Confirm metric movement
3) Close the change ticket
