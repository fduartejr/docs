title: AI Ops for Support Leaders, Part 2
description: Intake and triage system that keeps the AI backlog small.
---

Part 1 covered the operating model.
Part 2 covers intake and triage.

Goal
One path for every failure.
One set of labels.
One backlog.
Fast sorting.
Fast fixes.

What breaks in real teams
1) Feedback lands in ten places.
2) Labels vary by person.
3) No severity standard.
4) Same failure repeats for weeks.

Build one intake path
Pick one primary intake path.
A Zendesk form works well for Support orgs.
A GitHub issue template works well for docs-as-code teams.
A Slack workflow works well for speed, plus auto-ticket creation.

Lock the rule
All AI issues route into the same backlog.
No side chats.
No private spreadsheets.

Minimum fields
1) Channel
Options: chat, voice, email, help center
2) Surface
Options: bot answer, bot handoff, routing, tool action, content
3) Issue type
Options:
- Wrong answer
- Missing answer
- Policy mismatch
- Routing mistake
- Tool failure
- Tone problem
- Language or translation issue
- Data issue, tagging, fields, analytics
4) Severity
Options: S1, S2, S3
5) Evidence
Link to ticket, transcript, or screenshot
6) Expected result
One paragraph describing a correct result
7) Owner group
Options: Knowledge, Support Ops, Engineering, Policy

Severity rubric
S1
Risk, compliance, privacy, identity, payments, account access.
Also: high-volume failure affecting many users per day.
Response target: same day.

S2
Wrong guidance without direct risk.
Broken routing to wrong team.
Tool failures with workarounds.
Response target: 48 hours.

S3
Quality polish.
Low volume.
Edge cases.
Response target: next sprint.

Triage labels
Triage needs fast routing, not debate.

Label set
1) Knowledge gap
Source content missing, outdated, unclear.
2) Policy answer change
Policy shifted, new rule, new language required.
3) Workflow change
Routing, tags, forms, triggers, escalation logic.
4) Tool defect
API, integration, auth, action errors.
5) Red zone rule
Topic needs human handling or stricter refusal.
6) Needs context
Evidence incomplete, user goal unclear.

Triage flow
Run this in order.
1) Confirm severity using rubric.
2) Assign issue type.
3) Assign triage label.
4) Assign owner group.
5) Add one action note.
Example: “Update KB article X, add edge case Y, add refusal for scenario Z.”

Red zones and exclusions
Write red zones as a short list.
Keep red zones narrow and explicit.

Examples
1) Account access change
2) Identity verification
3) Payment status
4) Refund approval
5) Legal interpretation

Rule
If red zone triggered, handoff to human or refusal plus safe next step.

Failure pattern library
Track common patterns.
Use one sentence per pattern.

Examples
1) Partial user context, bot guesses.
2) Policy conflict across programs, bot merges rules.
3) Form mismatch, bot routes by wrong field.
4) Tool action fails, bot replies with fake success.

Each pattern gets a fix playbook
1) Content change
2) Prompt or tool change
3) Routing change
4) Monitoring rule
