title: AI Ops for Support Leaders, Part 5
description: Enablement, training, and coaching loops that keep adoption stable.
---

AI fails when people lose trust.
Trust drops when answers drift, handoffs break, or ownership looks vague.

Part 5 focuses on enablement.
You need training, habits, and feedback loops.

The goal
- Agents know what the bot does.
- Agents know when to step in.
- Agents report failures in a consistent way.
- Leaders ship fixes on a predictable cadence.

Define the agent contract
Write a short contract for the team.
Put it in the docs.
Review it in onboarding.

What the bot does
- Answers common questions.
- Collects missing context.
- Routes based on intent and rules.
- Hands off when risk appears.

What the bot does not do
- Make account access decisions
- Approve payments, refunds, or reimbursements
- Interpret policy when rules conflict
- Ask for sensitive data in chat
- Confirm identity

Agent actions during handoff
- Read the bot transcript first
- Confirm the user goal in one sentence
- Resolve or route using the same rules as before
- Tag the conversation if the bot failed
