title: AI Ops for Support Leaders, Part 7
description: Risk, incident response, and governance that protect trust.
---

AI incidents happen.
Most teams fail the response, not the model.

Part 7 focuses on risk control.
You need clear rules, fast shutdown paths, and a post-incident loop.

The goal
- Detect issues fast.
- Stop harm fast.
- Fix root cause.
- Prevent repeats.

Define risk levels
Use three levels.

High risk
- Identity
- Account access
- Payments
- Legal or compliance topics
- Private data exposure

Medium risk
- Policy guidance with real consequences
- Routing to the wrong team
- Wrong steps that block completion

Low risk
- Tone issues
- Formatting issues
- Minor gaps with safe fallbacks

Add a kill switch
You need a shutdown path for each channel.
Examples:
- Disable bot replies
- Disable tool actions
- Force handoff on all intents
- Disable a single flow or intent

Write the rule
Who triggers the kill switch.
What qualifies.
Who approves after the fact.

Incident detection
Use signals you already track.
- Spike in escalations
- Spike in repeats
- Drop in CSAT
- Spike in red zone attempts
- Increase in confirmed wrong answers

Add a manual signal
Agents need a fast flag.
One click.
One tag.
One queue.

Incident response roles
Assign these roles in advance.

Incident lead
- Runs the response
- Owns comms
- Owns the timeline

Fix owner
- Ships the fix
- Documents the change

QA owner
- Validates behavior
- Confirms regression tests

Policy partner
- Confirms language
- Confirms exclusions

Support comms owner
- Updates macros and templates
- Updates the status page text, if you use one

Incident flow
1) Detect
2) Triage severity
3) Decide on kill switch
4) Contain
5) Fix
6) Validate
7) Release
8) Monitor
9) Close

Containment actions
Pick the safest option first.
- Force handoff
- Remove a risky answer
- Add a refusal and safe next step
- Add a confirm step before risky guidance

Post-incident review
Run a short postmortem within 72 hours.

Postmortem format
- What happened
- User impact
- Root cause
- What worked
- What failed
- Fixes shipped
- Preventive actions
- Owners and due dates

Prevention
Add one preventive action per incident.
Examples:
- Add a monitoring rule
- Add a regression test prompt
- Add a red zone exclusion
- Add a content standard
- Add an approval gate

Ongoing governance
Run a weekly review.
Run a monthly risk review.

Weekly review
- Metrics
- Top failures
- Fixes shipped
- Release plan
- Red zone attempts

Monthly risk review
- Review red zones
- Review incident log
- Review approval compliance
- Review new tool actions
- Review audit trail

Series wrap
If you want AI to scale, run it like ops.
- Clear ownership
- Controlled change
- Measured outcomes
- Real enablement
- Real incident response

What to do next
- Write your kill switch rules
- Assign incident roles
- Add monitoring alerts
- Build a postmortem template
- Run the first monthly risk review
